# Working Document Index

Every working document in this repository is listed here, grouped by the
`Status` field of its header block. This index is derived from those headers
and regenerated when a document is created, retired, or re-statused; edit the
document's header, not this table. Read it first, pick the relevant document,
then read that document's `Current State` section before anything else.

Format, status vocabulary, ledger rules, worker briefs, and cross-repository
pairing are defined in
[Agent Working Document Protocol](./agent-working-doc-protocol.md).
